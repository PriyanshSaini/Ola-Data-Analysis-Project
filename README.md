# Ola-Data-Analysis-Project
Description:
Analyzed a comprehensive ride-sharing dataset to gain insights into operational performance, customer and driver behavior, and revenue trends. Leveraged SQL and Power BI to clean, analyze, and visualize data for actionable insights.

Key Contributions:

Developed SQL queries to retrieve successful bookings, calculate average ride distances by vehicle type, and identify top customers by ride volume.
Analyzed cancellation patterns and their reasons for both customers and drivers to identify areas of improvement.
Extracted performance metrics such as driver and customer ratings, ride distances, and booking values for financial and service quality analysis.
Created dynamic Power BI dashboards for visualization, including:
Ride Volume Trends: Time-series analysis of ride volume over days.
Booking Status Breakdown: Segmented analysis of successful, cancelled, and incomplete rides.
Customer and Driver Ratings Comparison: Quality assessment by vehicle type and booking value.
Cancellation Reasons Analysis: Visualization of customer and driver cancellation patterns.
Revenue Analysis: Breakdown of revenue by vehicle type and payment method.
Technologies Used:

SQL for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
Power BI for building interactive dashboards and presenting insights.
Advanced querying techniques including aggregations, joins, and conditional filtering.
Impact:

Enhanced decision-making by providing actionable insights into service efficiency, customer satisfaction, and revenue streams.
Identified key areas for operational improvements, leading to potential cost reductions and enhanced customer experience.
This project demonstrates proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving, essential for roles in data analytics and business intelligence
